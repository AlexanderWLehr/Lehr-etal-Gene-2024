This is the accompanying jupyter notebooks for "Analyses of Human Genetic Data to Identify Clinically Relevant Domains of Neuroligins" - Lehr et al., 2024. In this paper, critical regions within neuroligins are identified via clustering of clinically relevant missense variants.

The code for this approach can be found in "Final -Missense Analysis of Neuoligin Critical Domains.ipynb"

This approach can be adopted for other genes by downloading the clinvar.txt and gnomad.csv files from the correpsonding websites. Neuroligin protein domain features were added manually.

"NLGN Early Truncations Exon Map.ipynb" is the code that created the exon charts in figure 1. The early truncation variants were extracted from the clinvar and gnomad files.
